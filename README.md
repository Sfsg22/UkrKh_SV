            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Stanislav Vakulenko, and I am from Ukraine. The topic of Ukraine is deeply personal to me because it is my home, and I feel a spiritual connection with it. When I left Ukraine, I didn’t go directly to Canada. I lived in Europe for a while, visiting countries like Hungary, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, and others. Some of these moves were easier than others, but the hardest was the journey from Ukraine to Hungary during heavy shelling in my hometown, Kharkiv.</p>
            <p>Kharkiv is one of the cities most affected by the war, but its people remain resilient and unyielding. I miss my home and hope to return soon, even if just to visit my relatives and friends who stayed behind.</p>

            <h2>Culture & Traditions</h2>
            <p>Ukraine is rich in culture and traditions, which I hold dear even while living abroad. Our traditional clothing is the embroidered vyshyvanka, and our cuisine includes delicious dishes like borscht, varenyky, and deruny. We also have many holidays, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Independence Day (August 24)</li>
                <li>Christmas (January 7)</li>
                <li>Easter</li>
                <li>Ivan Kupala Night</li>
                <li>Day of Unity (January 22)</li>
                <li>Victory Day (May 9)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Impact of the War</h2>
            <p>The war has had a devastating effect on Ukraine. Fertile lands that once flourished are now uninhabitable. Fear gripped the hearts of many, but those who remained adapted to the new reality. For me, the war meant leaving my home, but my connection to Ukraine remains unbroken.</p>

            <h2>My City: Kharkiv</h2>
            <p>Kharkiv, founded in 1654, is the second-largest city in Ukraine with a total area of 350 square kilometers. It is known as the "city of students" due to its many universities and a vibrant atmosphere that brought students from across the country and abroad.</p>
            <p>Before the war, Kharkiv was famous for its cleanliness, beauty, and landmarks like Freedom Square and Kharkiv University. The war has brought devastation to the city, but its people remain strong and determined.</p>
            <p>I have many fond memories of growing up in Kharkiv. During summer, my friends and I played basketball on one of the many sports courts available across the city. Kharkiv was full of places for sports, including football fields, basketball courts, hockey rinks, and even outdoor gyms, which were common sights. I also remember going to outdoor cinemas with friends, which was always a special experience.</p>
            <p>Another cherished memory is horseback riding with my father. In winter, almost every day, I would go skiing or snowboarding with my stepfather and sometimes with friends. These moments are etched in my heart and remind me of the vibrant life we had in Kharkiv.</p>

            <p><strong>Ukrainian:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Ще не вмерла України і слава, і воля,<br>
                Ще нам, браття молодії, усміхнеться доля.<br>
                Згинуть наші воріженьки, як роса на сонці,<br>
                Запануємо і ми, браття, у своїй сторонці.
            </p>
            <p><strong>English:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Ukraine’s glory has not yet perished, nor her freedom,<br>
                Upon us, fellow Ukrainians, fate shall smile once more.<br>
                Our enemies will vanish like dew in the morning sun,<br>
                And we too shall rule, brothers, in our own land.
